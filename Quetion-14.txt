Negative indexes are more efficient and considered more readable than other indexes.

# Negative Indexing is used to in Python to begin slicing from the end of the string i.e. the last

# Negative indexing is used in Python to manipulate sequence objects such as lists, arrays, and strings. In NumPy,
 this feature is extended to multi-dimensional arrays

   print(my_list[-1])   # Output: 'orangeRead'
