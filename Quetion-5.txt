Q: What is the purpose continue statement in python?
Ans:

   The continue statement in Python is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration only.
It is often used in conjunction with an if statement to control the flow of execution within a loop.

For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it will skip the number 5:

for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 5:
        continue
    print(i)
